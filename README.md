# PANDORA API

### What is PANDORA API?
    Simple API with get function that reads from a plain text (or a db file).
    And a tool for my own testing purposes and to develop fast solutions that requires an api integration.
    
### Modular
    You can make this API get basically anything that you want, even use Python 3 calls in real time,
    but there are some limitations, most of them are based on the system that you're running.
    
### Why?
    Because all the other APIs that are out there either are paid or they just have some infuriating
    stuff that i dont mind at all, so I decided to make my own tool.
  
### ETC
    It has the CORS bullshit and it is a dreadfully pain to get around it, but there are some ways to use it
    in a real test enviroment, but I'll let you on your on on this journey.

#### It kinda has a post function, but its bugged AF and you can use https with it, but you gonna need an OpenSSL certificade.
